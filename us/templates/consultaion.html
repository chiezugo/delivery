                                We always have a collaborative approach to transport planning, founding and development.
                                This is an approach that delivers integrated transport solutions that meet the needs of
                                customers. Also we do consultations for many categories like programs, policies and
                                projects according to specific scope, process and consultation principles. No successful
                                freight policy is possible without proper consultation with freight companies, with
                                local business groups and their public stakeholders too.

                                Freight portal is an essential feature of a good communication with their operators and
                                other stakeholders. In urban freight transport, it provides information on truck access
                                and delivery regulations, the provision of loading and unloading and other specific
                                information.

                                Before consult the stakeholders, it is very important to know who they are and what is
                                their interest and power in it. The goods are loaded in to load unit then the entire
                                load unit is transferred between transport modes at interchanges as required during the
                                transport.
